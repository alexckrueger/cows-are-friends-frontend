# Cows Are Friends

##### ([Not Food](https://c.tenor.com/eTVPYFuW-TcAAAAC/fishy-fish-are-friends.gif))

I am a veggie, meaning I have a vegetarian-like dietary restriction. When I'm choosing to go out to eat, I typically either stick with what I know or go to a place that is specifically for vegetarians/vegans. I've been to far too many places that say they have vegetarian options only to show up and be offered a side salad. This is why I created Cows Are Friends.

## About My App

Cows Are Friends gives vegetarians and vegans a place to review all types of restaurants specifically on how veggie-friendly they are. We can simply search any restaurant and view reviews made by other veggies whenever we're looking for a place to eat, looking to see what's in the area, or perhaps being dragged out by friends or family against your will.

I created this using Ruby on Rails for the backend and Vue 3 for the frontend along with integrating Yelpâ€™s API and multiple javascript libraries.

This was my first ever individual project. [I wrote more about my learning experience on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexckrueger_cows-are-friends-activity-6912532587500470272-gmGU/?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web).

## How to use

This app is deployed! You can [see it in action for yourself](https://cows-are-friends.netlify.app/).

Anyone visiting the app is able to look up what restaurants are in their area, view the restaurants on the map, and visit the individual page of each restaurant. On the individual page, you can view the reviews left by users of this website. Searching near "Chicago" or "60613" will show you restaurants with data I seeded myself.

You have the ability to make an account. Users are able to make and update reviews, view their review history, favorite restaurants, and change their user information. If you don't want to create your own account, you can just log in as "alex@gmail.com" with a very secure password of "password".
